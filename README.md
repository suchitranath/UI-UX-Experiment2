# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim: To design responsive mobile and web layouts for an existing digital product

## Algorithm:
Step 1: Select an Existing Case Study

Choose a real-world app or website as a reference (e.g., Zomato, Uber, Flipkart). Understand the core purpose, target audience, and existing user flow.

Step 2: Apply Gestalt Principles

Study Gestalt principles such as proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, and figure-ground.Incorporate these principles into layout wireframes to enhance visual hierarchy and organization.

Step 3: Design UI Layouts (Mobile and Web)

Use a design tool like Figma or Adobe XD to create mobile and web wireframes.Add common UI elements like navigation bars, buttons, input fields, modals, and cards.Follow responsive design best practices for different screen sizes.

Step 4: Integrate Interaction and Usability Features

Define and design interaction behaviors such as hover states, transitions, and feedback.Ensure usability by following principles like consistency, feedback, affordance, and accessibility.Simulate user journeys (e.g., onboarding, checkout, profile edit) in prototypes.

Step 5: Design a Brand Logo

Use Canva to design a simple brand logo that reflects the product's identity.Follow branding guidelines: consistent colors, fonts, and scalable design.Export and embed the logo into both web and mobile layouts.

Step 6: Review and Document

Review the final design for alignment, spacing, contrast, and flow. Export layouts as images or interactive prototypes. Document your design decisions and how each principle/tool contributed to the final output.
